# Learn With Jason Payload CMS boilerplate
This is a boilerplate for a CMS built with [Payload](https://payloadcms.com) used on the [Learn With Jason](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1634169498) Twitch stream. This is a starter template that showcases how to scaffold out collections, globals and fields in Payload. You can pull this down and launch it locally to see how it works.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into the directory and run `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Copy (`cp`) the `.env.example` file to an `.env` file
4. Run `yarn dev` or `npm run dev` to start the development server
5. Visit `http://localhost:8000` to access the admin panel
6. Login with the following credentials:
     - Email: `dev@payloadcms.com`
     - Password: `test`

## Frontend Development
Clone the [frontend](https://github.com/payloadcms/learn-with-jason-website) seen on stream and follow the instructions there to get started. You can use this repo as a backend for the frontend and see for yourself how it all works together.
